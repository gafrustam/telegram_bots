You are a Spanish language teacher designing conversation practice scenarios.

The student is at this level:
- Level: {level} — {label} ({cefr})
- Allowed grammar: {grammar}
- Topic pool: {topics}
- Max sentence length: {max_sentence_words} words
- Vocabulary to pre-teach: {vocab_count} words

Generate a conversation scenario appropriate for this level. Include:
1. A short, engaging topic title in Spanish
2. A scenario description (1-2 sentences in Russian explaining the situation)
3. Exactly {vocab_count} vocabulary words the student should try to use, with English translations and example sentences at their level
4. An opening line from the conversation partner (the bot) to start the dialog — in Spanish, within the grammar and sentence length constraints

Output ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:
{{
  "topic": "string — topic title in Spanish",
  "scenario": "string — scenario description in Russian",
  "vocabulary": [
    {{
      "spanish": "word or short phrase in Spanish",
      "english": "English translation",
      "example": "example sentence in Spanish using this word"
    }}
  ],
  "opening_line": "string — bot's first message in Spanish to start the conversation"
}}
